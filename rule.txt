Database Schema (SQLite)
Please use this schema structure:
users (id, username, password_hash, role)
categories (id, name, icon_class)
tutorials (id, title, slug, description, difficulty, duration, category_id, author_id, created_at, view_count)
steps (id, tutorial_id, step_number, title, content, image_path)
materials (id, tutorial_id, name, quantity, local_source)
Security Requirements
Use Prepared Statements for all SQLite queries to prevent SQL Injection.
Hash passwords using password_hash().
Sanitize all user inputs.
Protect the admin panel with session-based authentication.
Prevent direct access to /includes folder.
Deliverables
Please generate the project structure and code for the following files:
Outline the folder structure first.
includes/config.php (Database connection & constants)
includes/functions.php (Helper functions)
public/index.php (Homepage with featured tutorials)
public/tutorial.php (Single tutorial view with step-by-step logic)
public/admin/login.php & public/admin/index.php (Admin logic)
public/manifest.json (For PWA installation)
public/sw.js (Service Worker for offline caching)
Start by outlining the folder structure, then provide the code for each file step-by-step. Ensure the code is commented and easy for a beginner PHP developer to maintain.
